# LTHS-Cybersecurity-DIY-Cypher

The cypher I made for my cybersecurity class in our encryption unit.

## Building

For most people, attached binaries will be sufficient. If you want to build from source, you will need to have the Rust programming language installed. You can install it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/). Clone the directory and run `cargo build --release` to build the binary.

## How to use

The program is a command line tool. Run `lths_cybersecurity_diy_cypher --help` for usage information.
